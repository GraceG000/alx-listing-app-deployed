# 🏠 ALX Listing App

## 📖 About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** is a foundational project that lays the groundwork for creating a modern Airbnb clone. This milestone focuses on building a well-structured, scalable, and production-ready codebase using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**.  

The goal is to establish a clean project architecture with reusable components, clear type definitions, and consistent styling — ensuring a robust starting point for a responsive and user-friendly property listing page.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Scaffold a **Next.js** project with **TypeScript**, **ESLint**, and **TailwindCSS** preconfigured.  
- Implement reusable UI components such as **Card** and **Button** for modular design.  
- Use **TypeScript interfaces** to maintain type safety and improve code maintainability.  
- Structure the app following **industry best practices** for scalability and clarity.  
- Organize assets efficiently under the `public/` directory for easy access.
